    "\n",
    "- Please write commented code. You can also use text cells for your comments and explanations.\n",
    "- The code must follow the good coding principles (it must be clean, readable, etc.). \n",
    "- Graphs must have a title, a legend and their axes must be labeled. \n",
    "- At the end, submit your notebooks __and a pdf file of 5 to 8 pages__ into the Moodle Assignment you will find in the section \"Assessment: projects\".\n",
    "This separate pdf file is intended to be a (very) short paper : a standalone document that summarizes the work you have carried out in the notebooks and the results you have obtained (being they positive or negative), with figures. It has to be self-contained in the sense that one has to be able to read your report and understand its content without having to look into your notebooks, which will be checked afterwards. "
